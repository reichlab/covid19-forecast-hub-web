          Every week dozens of modeling teams from across the globe submit forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US to our [forecast data repository](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub). In collaboration with the US CDC, we take these data and build a single ensemble forecast which is later analyzed by, and communicated to the general public by CDC.
