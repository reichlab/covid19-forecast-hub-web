    content: >-
      As of Wednesday, May 1, 2024, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub stopped accepting forecast submissions. From 2020 to 2024, this site collected real-time forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations, cases and deaths for the US, created by dozens of leading infectious disease modeling teams from around the globe, in coordination with the US CDC.

          Every week dozens of modeling teams from across the globe submitted forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US to our [forecast data repository](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub). In collaboration with the US CDC, we took these data and built a single ensemble forecast which was later analyzed by, and communicated to the general public by CDC.

           COVID-19 Forecast Hub data were used by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/forecasting/mathematical-modeling.html" target="_blank">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the data journalism site <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>. Through these channels, and our [public data repository](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub), our work served as a vital source of public information about where the outbreak was headed.
