<strong>Note:</strong> As of Wednesday, May 1, 2024, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub is no longer accepting submissions. Information provided on forecast submissions are kept for historical record.

All teams building COVID-19 forecasting models are welcome to join the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. To participate, teams must submit a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/" target="_blank">COVID-19 Forecast Hub GitHub repository</a> with at least one forecast data file and a metadata file about their model. 

Forecasts must follow the guidelines laid out in our <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-processed/README.md" target="_blank">technical README file</a> on GitHub. Upon submission of a pull request, all new files are run through <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/wiki/Data-Validation" target="_blank">a series of validation and verification checks</a> to ensure that all data are in the correct format. The results of these checks will be visible on GitHub and if errors occur, you can check failure messages by following <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/wiki/Troubleshooting-Pull-Requests" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.

If not otherwise specified, all submitted data will be released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0 license</a>. Teams are encouraged to use this license to maximize the potential for reuse both for non-commercial (i.e. academic research) and commercial (i.e. vaccine development) uses. However, teams are also permitted to submit their forecasts under a separate specified license agreement.
