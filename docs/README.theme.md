# Libris

A documentation theme for Stackbit. [Live Demo](https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/libris/blue)

[![Create with Stackbit](https://assets.stackbit.com/badge/create-with-stackbit.svg)](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbithq/stackbit-theme-libris)

### Turn themes into CMS-powered websites

[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) provisions your theme's content model with a growing selection of headless CMS and pulls the content for you in the format your static site generator expects it. This is powered by a single config file, [stackbit.yaml](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/stackbit-yaml/), which defines a [Uniform theme model](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/) and enables integration with CMS like Contentful, DatoCMS, Forestry, NetlifyCMS, etc.

### One theme codebase converts to multiple Static Site Generators

This theme in particular is written in [Unibit](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/), a superset of static site generators. Unibit's powerful transpiling engine enables you to write once and stay SSG agnostic. Themes will automatically work with new generators as they are added and can currently convert to Jekyll, Hugo & Gatsby.

## Quickstart

### Unibit CLI

Develop locally using the Unibit CLI. 

```
npm install -g @stackbit/unibit
```

Start the local development server. 

```
unibit develop
```

# Theme Documentation

### Editing & adding docs pages

All documentation pages must be located inside the `content/docs` folder. You can create folders inside this folder 1 level deep. For example:

- Documentation root page: `docs/index.md`
- Parent section pages: `docs/<section_name>/index.md`
- Child section pages: `docs/<section_name>/<page_name>.md` 

Documentation pages should contain the following front matter. `title` and `layout` are required. 

```
---
- `title`: apart from defining the page title, docs layout use this field to
  label navigation menu items.
- `weight`: defines the order of the child section page. This field is ignored
  for parent section pages.
- `layout`: docs
- `excerpt`: Can be defined on a parent section pages to render the description
  of the section in the Overview page (`overview.html`). This field is ignored
  for child section pages. 
---
```

All page inside the `content/docs` folder should use the `docs` layout (`layouts/docs.html`).
This layout is responsible for rendering the documentation navigation menu and
uses several properties to control its appearance: 

### Docs menu

For sections to appear in the docs sidebar menu they must be defined in `doc_sections.yml` located
inside the `data` folder. The order of section in this list will define the appearance order in navigation menu.  

`doc_sections.yml`:

```yaml
root_folder: /docs/
sections:
  - about
  - getting-started
  - ui-components
  - manage-content
  - tools
  - faq
  - community
```
 
### Example

Here is an example to a folder structure, several documentation pages and
documentation sections:

```
.
├── data
│   ├── doc_sections.yml
│   └── ...
├── content
│   ├── docs
│   │   ├── getting-started
│   │   │   ├── index.md         [section parent page]
│   │   │   ├── installation.md  [section child page]
│   │   │   └── quick-start.md   [section child page]
│   │   ├── guides
│   │   │   ├── index.md         [section parent page]
│   │   │   ├── features.md      [section child page]
│   │   │   └── overview.md      [section child page]
│   │   ├── faq
│   │   │   └── index.md         [section parent page]
│   │   └── index.md             [documentation root page]
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

`content/docs/guides/overview.md`:

    ---
    title: Overview
    weight: 1           # position guides/overview first
    layout: docs
    ---
   
`content/docs/guides/features.md`:

    ---
    title: Features
    weight: 2           # position guides/features second
    layout: docs
    ---

`data/doc_sections.yml`:

```yaml
root_folder: /docs/
sections:
  - getting-started
  - guides
  - faq
```

### Callouts

To add a callout to your documentation, simply use the following html markup:

```
<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> 
  This is the "Important" callout block of text. It indicates a warning or caution.
  Use it for an important message. 
</div>
```

```
<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  This is the "Note" callout block of text. It signifies a general note.
</div>
```

### Syntax Highlighter

To enable syntax highlighting in your code blocks, add a language identifier. For example, to syntax highlight JavaScript code, specify `javascript` next to the tick marks before the fenced code block:

````
```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
````

## Editing the Homepage

The homepage content uses `content/index.md`. You can edit all of the homepage sections by editing this files front matter.

## Main Navigation

The items of the main menu located at the top can be defined inside the `config.yml` file.

To add a menu item, you should define it inside the `nav_links` field. For instance:

    nav_links:
      - label: Home
        url: /
        type: link
        has_subnav: false

## Additional Layouts

Besides the usual layouts (`blog`, `page`, `post`) and documentation layout mentioned above (`docs`), there is an additional layout `advanced` that can be used for pages.

## Social Links

To display social icons in the footer, define them inside the `social_links` field inside the `config.yml` file. You can use any icon supported by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands) and just need to specify the appropriate Font Awesome class name as the `icon_class` value.

## Color palettes

Libris supports the following color palettes:

- blue (default)
- green
- navy
- violet

To change the color palette, update the `palette` variable in config.yml.
